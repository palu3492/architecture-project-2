One document (pdf) outlining the results of the test suite and the performance of the
multi-cycle design relative to the single-cycle design.

There is no point to the benchmark suite without some analysis. Once you have developed your
benchmark suite you should run it on both your single-cycle and multicycle designs and record the
number of cycles executed in each test. You should then write up a 3-4 page document (double
spaced) outlining the performance of the multicycle machine relative to the single-cycle machine. It is
important to compare your experimental results to theoretically predicated behavior. Make sure to
detail what equations you use (and those equations should be nicely formatted). NOTE: You may
assume the clock in the single-cycle design is 9 times slower than the clock in multicycle design.

The best way to debug your programs is to generate your own test cases, figure out the correct answers
by hand, and compare your program's output to the correct answers. This is also one of the best ways to
learn the concepts in the project.

Your benchmark suite will be graded according to how thoroughly its tests the UST-3400 simulators.
